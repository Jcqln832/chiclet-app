## Introduction

Chiclet allows users to plan and keep track of their year by month. A user can add items such as special events, goal deadlines, or focus themes to the months and the app provides a view of the entire year. Alternatively, the app can be used as an accomplishment record keeper rather than a planner of future milestones. Users can add new items, delete items, and edit items. 

This app is a capstone project for Thinkful's full stack JavaScript program. 

## Build

Chiclet is build with React and Flexbox CSS for the front end. The back end is built with Express, and Postgres for the databse. The database and server and hosted with Heroku.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
